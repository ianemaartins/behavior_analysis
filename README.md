### Personal Behavioral Data Tracker

This project is an effort to compile and analyze various aspects of my daily behavior to gain insights and improve personal habits. The dataset includes information on:

- Sleep hours
- Screen time
- Diet and nutrition
- Physical exercise
- Menstrual cycle
- Humor
- Weather

By visualizing and analyzing these data points, I aim to identify patterns and correlations that can lead to healthier and more balanced routines. Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have suggestions or ideas, don't hesitate to reach out!
